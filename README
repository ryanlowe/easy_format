= easy_format plugin for Ruby on Rails

  easy_format is a Rails plugin that formats and escapes database
  text for use in HTML views. The result looks a lot like text in
  Gmail: line breaks are converted and links are linked.
  
  It will not support tags like BBCode; it just formats plain text.

== Installation

  It looks like Rails 2.1 will support "script/plugin install" with Git
  repositories.  Until then you can put this plugin in vendor/plugins with:

  git clone git://github.com/ryanlowe/easy_format.git

  and delete the .git directory inside it before committing it to source control.

  When Rails 2.1 supports Git you should be able to do:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/ryanlowe/easy_format.git

== Usage

  <%= EasyFormat.format(@post.body) %>
  
  Note: HTML angle brackets are escaped by format() so
  you do not need to use h() as well.
